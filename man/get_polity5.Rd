\subsection{Polity5}{

The Polity5 project continues the Polity research tradition of coding the
authority characteristics of states in the world system for purposes of
comparative, quantitative analysis. The original Polity conceptual scheme was
formulated and the initial Polity I data collected under the direction of Ted
Robert Gurr and informed by foundational, collaborative work with Harry
Eckstein, Patterns of Authority: A Structural Basis for Political Inquiry
(New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1975). The Polity project has proven its value
to researchers over the years, becoming the most widely used resource for
monitoring regime change and studying the effects of regime authority.
\subsection{Structure}{

The Polity5 dataset contains 17,574 country-year observations and 37
variables. For more information regarding variable descriptions and other
dataset documentation, please refer to the
