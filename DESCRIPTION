Description: An open-source toolkit developed by ISciences, LLC and the DANTE 
    Project that is intended for learning, accessing, pre-processing, and 
    visualizing popular political, institutional, and constitutional datasets. 
    ‘demcon' aims to reduce barriers to entry in political science research by 
    automating common acquisition and pre-processing procedures. This package 
    particularly focuses on the V-Dem dataset (<https://www.v-dem.net/vdemds.html>),
    and provides adaptations of methods presented in Fjelde, H., Knutsen, C. H. 
    & Nygård, H. M. 2021, <doi:10.1093/isq/sqaa076>.
